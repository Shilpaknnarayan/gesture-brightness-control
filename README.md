# âœ‹ Gesture-Based Brightness Control

Control your screen brightness using hand gestures (thumb & index finger) via MediaPipe and OpenCV.
This project uses hand gestures detected via webcam to control screen brightness in real-time. It uses [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) for hand tracking and `screen_brightness_control` to change brightness levels based on the distance between your thumb and index finger.
